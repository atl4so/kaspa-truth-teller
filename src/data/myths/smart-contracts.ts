    claim: "The current lack of smart contracts on Kaspa makes it irrelevant and incapable of competing in the modern crypto landscape. THIS IS A SHORT-SIGHTED AND INACCURATE ASSESSMENT.",
    facts: [
      "Smart contract functionality is a top priority and actively under development for Kaspa. The Kaspa team is committed to bringing robust smart contract capabilities to the network. Smart contracts are coming to Kaspa.",
      "The current absence of deployed smart contracts is a temporary phase in Kaspa's planned development trajectory, not a permanent limitation. Kaspa is strategically building a strong foundation before deploying smart contracts.",
      "Kaspa's existing strengths in unparalleled scalability, blazing-fast transaction speeds, and robust PoW security provide a uniquely powerful and secure foundation upon which to build a thriving smart contract ecosystem. Kaspa is building a superior platform for future smart contracts.",
      "Kaspa is not 'obsolete'; it is strategically focusing on building a superior base layer first. The planned integration of smart contracts will unlock vast new potential for Kaspa, making it highly competitive and innovative."
