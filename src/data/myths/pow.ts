    claim: "Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is unequivocally superior to Proof-of-Work (PoW) in every meaningful way.",
    facts: [
      "The supposed 'superiority' of PoS is not a universally accepted fact but a heavily debated topic, deeply influenced by complex and unpredictable economic factors, not just theoretical mathematical models.",
      "Claims that 'PoS is factually better' lack objective, universally agreed-upon evidence and often ignore critical security and decentralization trade-offs.",
      "PoW and PoS represent fundamentally different approaches with distinct security, decentralization, and economic characteristics.",
      "The computational work in PoW provides essential cryptographic proof of the blockchain's accumulated work and security.",
      "PoW's computational cost is directly tied to network security and is not 'wasteful'.",
      "Both PoW and PoS require economic incentives to secure the network, using different but comparable mechanisms."

    claim: "PoW mining is only for wealthy corporations and specialized entities, excluding ordinary individuals.",
    facts: [
      "Kaspa's innovative high Block Per Second (BPS) design specifically enables broader mining participation.",
      "The initial investment required to start mining Kaspa can be surprisingly low.",
      "Multiple mining pools operate independently, fostering decentralization.",
      "Individual miners can effectively participate in the network.",
      "The network has a healthy distribution of hash power.",
      "Kaspa's architecture promotes a more distributed and egalitarian mining ecosystem."

    title: "Environmental Impact",
    category: "Proof-of-Work (PoW)",
    claim: "PoW mining is a major environmental threat due to its excessive energy consumption.",
    facts: [
      "While PoW mining does consume energy, the environmental impact can be significantly mitigated through renewable energy sources.",
      "The energy used secures a decentralized, permissionless financial network, providing valuable global service.",
      "Ongoing technological advancements in mining hardware and algorithms hold promise for reducing energy intensity.",
      "Many mining operations are actively transitioning to renewable energy sources.",
      "The energy consumption argument often overlooks the value and utility provided by secure, decentralized networks.",
      "Comparing PoW energy use to traditional financial systems provides important context often missing from the debate."
